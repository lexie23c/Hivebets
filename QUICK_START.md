## Understanding Odds

HiveBets uses parimutuel betting:

- Odds are determined by the ratio of YES to NO bets
- More bets on YES = lower YES odds, higher NO odds
- Odds update in real-time as bets are placed
- No house edge - winners split the losing pool

### Example

Market: "Will BNB hit $1,200?"
- YES pool: 10 BNB
- NO pool: 5 BNB
- You bet 1 BNB on YES

If YES wins:
- Total YES pool: 11 BNB (including your bet)
- You get: (1 / 11) Ã— 15 BNB = 1.36 BNB
- Your profit: 0.36 BNB (36% return)
- Plus cashback: ~0.01 BNB
- Total return: ~1.37 BNB

## Common Questions

### Is HiveBets safe?
Yes. All funds are held in audited smart contracts. Your wallet controls your funds at all times. Hivebets Oracle ensures fair resolution.

You lose your bet amount, but you still earn cashback. If you referred friends, you also earn referral commissions.

### Can I bet on both sides?
Yes, but it's generally not profitable due to the 2% fee. Better to choose one side based on your research.

### When can I claim?
Immediately after the market resolves. Resolution happens automatically via Hivebets Oracle within 1 hour of deadline.

### How does gasless betting work?
x402 protocol allows you to sign messages instead of transactions. Our facilitator sponsors the gas and submits your bet on-chain.

### What if the oracle fails?
Hivebets Oracle aggregates data from multiple sources. If resolution fails, the market can be cancelled and all bets refunded.

## What is HiveBets?

HiveBets is a fully decentralized prediction market platform built on BNB Chain. We let you bet on real-world outcomes from crypto token prices to social events with complete transparency and trustless execution.

Traditional betting platforms are centralized, opaque, and take your funds off-chain. HiveBets changes this. Every bet is recorded on the blockchain. Every outcome is resolved by our proprietary Hivebets Oracle system pulling data from multiple verified sources. Your funds stay in your wallet until you place a bet, and winners are paid automatically through smart contracts.

Whether you're predicting the next Four.meme token to moon, BNB hitting a price target, or even CZ's tweet activity, HiveBets provides a fair, transparent, and community-driven platform where the hive always wins together.

# The Problem

## Memecoin Trading is Inefficient

Trading memecoins involves significant risks and challenges:

### High Risk, High Friction

* **Rug pulls and scams** plague the memecoin space
* **Timing the market** requires 24/7 monitoring and quick execution
* **Slippage and MEV** eat into profits on volatile moves
* **No structured way** to express conviction without holding tokens

### Capital Inefficiency

Traditional memecoin trading requires:

* Full token purchase and custody
* Constant price monitoring
* Emotional decision-making during volatility
* Exit timing pressure

### Limited Tools for Speculation

While DeFi has matured with sophisticated instruments like options, perps, and structured products, **memecoin speculation remains primitive**:

* Either you buy the token or you don't
* No way to bet on specific outcomes (e.g., "Will this reach $100M mcap?")
* No hedging mechanisms
* No risk-defined positions

## The Gap

**HiveBets solves this by creating structured prediction markets** that allow traders to:

Express conviction on specific price targets\
Define risk upfront (max 0.5 BNB per market)\
Avoid custody and rug risk\
Compete in transparent, on-chain markets

Instead of buying a memecoin and hoping it moons, **you simply bet on the outcome**.

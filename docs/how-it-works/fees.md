# Platform Fees

## Fee Structure

HiveBets has a simple, transparent fee structure:

| Fee Type           | Amount       | When Charged     | Who Pays      |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Platform Fee**   | .5%          | On winnings only | Winners       |
| **Gas Fee**        | \~$0.10-0.20 | Per transaction  | User (always) |
| **Deposit Fee**    | 0%           | Never            | Nobody        |
| **Withdrawal Fee** | 0%           | Never            | Nobody        |

***

## Platform Fee (0.5%)

### How It Works

The platform charges .&#x35;**% of winnings** only:

```
Example:
You bet 1 BNB on YES
YES wins
Losing pool share allocated to you: 0.5 BNB
Platform fee: .5% × 0.5 = 0.01 BNB
You receive: 1 BNB (stake) + 0.5 - 0.01 = 1.49 BNB
```

### Key Points

**Only on winnings**, not on your initial stake\
**Only if you win** - losers pay no fee (they lose their bet)\
**Transparent** - deducted automatically by smart contract\
**No hidden fees** - .5% is the total platform fee

### Comparison

| Platform                      | Fee              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **HiveBets**                  | .5% on winnings  |
| Traditional sportsbook        | 4-10% house edge |
| Centralized prediction market | 2-5% on all bets |
| DEX trading fees              | 0.3-1% per trade |

## Gas Fees

### What Are Gas Fees?

**Gas fees** are transaction costs on the BSC blockchain. Every blockchain interaction (bet, claim, etc.) requires gas.

### HiveBets Gas Costs

Approximate costs on **BSC Mainnet**:

| Action             | Gas Used      | Cost (@ 3 Gwei) | Cost (USD @ $600 BNB) |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Place Bet**      | \~100,000 gas | 0.0003 BNB      | \~$0.18               |
| **Claim Winnings** | \~80,000 gas  | 0.00024 BNB     | \~$0.14               |
| **Check Odds**     | 0 gas         | Free            | Free                  |
| **View Stakes**    | 0 gas         | Free            | Free                  |

### Why BSC?

We chose BSC over Ethereum because:

| Network      | Gas Cost          | Speed     |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| **Ethereum** | $10-50 per tx     | 15-60 sec |
| **BSC**      | $0.10-0.20 per tx | 3-5 sec   |
| **Polygon**  | $0.01-0.05 per tx | 2-3 sec   |

BSC offers the best balance of:

* Low fees
* Fast confirmation
* Proven security
* Large user base

### Gas Price Fluctuations

Gas fees vary based on network congestion:

**Low congestion** (night, off-peak):

* \~3 Gwei
* $0.10-0.15 per transaction

**High congestion** (day, busy times):

* \~5 Gwei
* $0.20-0.30 per transaction

**Extreme congestion** (very rare):

* \~10 Gwei
* $0.40-0.60 per transaction

💡 **Tip**: Transact during off-peak hours to save on gas.

## Total Cost Breakdown

### Example 1: Small Bet

```
Bet: 0.01 BNB on YES
Outcome: YES wins
Winning share: 0.005 BNB

Costs:
- Bet transaction gas: 0.0003 BNB ($0.18)
- Platform fee: .5% × 0.005 = 0.0001 BNB ($0.06)
- Claim transaction gas: 0.00024 BNB ($0.14)
- Total fees: 0.00064 BNB ($0.38)

Payout:
- Stake returned: 0.01 BNB
- Winnings after fee: 0.0049 BNB
- Total received: 0.0149 BNB

Net profit: 0.0149 - 0.01 = 0.0049 BNB
After gas: 0.0049 - 0.00054 = 0.00436 BNB (~$2.62)

ROI: 43.6%
```

### Example 2: Max Bet

```
Bet: 0.1 BNB on NO
Outcome: NO wins
Winning share: 0.15 BNB (NO was minority)

Costs:
- Bet transaction gas: 0.0003 BNB ($0.18)
- Platform fee: .5% × 0.15 = 0.003 BNB ($1.80)
- Claim transaction gas: 0.00024 BNB ($0.14)
- Total fees: 0.00354 BNB ($2.12)

Payout:
- Stake returned: 0.1 BNB
- Winnings after fee: 0.147 BNB
- Total received: 0.247 BNB

Net profit: 0.247 - 0.1 = 0.147 BNB
After gas: 0.147 - 0.00054 = 0.14646 BNB (~$87.88)

ROI: 146.46%
```

### Example 3: Losing Bet

```
Bet: 0.05 BNB on YES
Outcome: NO wins

Costs:
- Bet transaction gas: 0.0003 BNB ($0.18)
- Platform fee: 0 (you didn't win)
- Claim transaction: 0 (nothing to claim)
- Total fees: 0.0003 BNB ($0.18)

Payout: 0 BNB

Loss: -0.05 BNB (-$30)
Total lost including gas: -0.0503 BNB (-$30.18)

ROI: -100.6%
```

## Gas Optimization

We've optimized contracts to minimize gas:

### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Efficient Data Storage**
   * Use uint96 instead of uint256 where possible
   * Pack variables into single storage slots
   * Saves \~50% gas on state updates
2. **Minimal External Calls**
   * Batch operations where possible
   * Reduce oracle queries
   * Saves \~30% gas
3. **Simple Logic**
   * No complex loops
   * Direct calculations
   * Predictable gas costs

### Result

Our contracts use **less gas than typical DeFi protocols**:

| Protocol Type      | Avg Gas per Transaction |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Uniswap swap       | \~150,000 gas           |
| **HiveBets bet**   | **\~100,000 gas**       |
| **HiveBets claim** | **\~80,000 gas**        |
| NFT mint           | \~200,000 gas           |

## Future Fee Optimizations

Potential improvements:

### 1. Gas Rebates

For high-volume users:

* Bet >1 BNB cumulative → 10% gas rebate
* Bet >5 BNB cumulative → 25% gas rebate

### 2. Fee Staking

Stake platform tokens to reduce fees:

* Stake 100 tokens → 1.8% fee (instead of .5%)
* Stake 1000 tokens → 1.5% fee

### 3. Volume Discounts

Lower fees for bigger bets:

* 0.01-0.05 BNB → .5% fee
* 0.05-0.1 BNB → 1.5% fee

### 4. Layer 2

If BSC gas gets expensive:

* Migrate to BSC Layer 2 or sidechain
* Could reduce gas 10x

## Fee FAQs

### Do I pay fees if I lose?

No platform fee. You only pay gas for the bet transaction (\~$0.18).

### Can I avoid the .5% fee?

No. It's automatically deducted by the smart contract from all winning payouts.

### Why is there a fee at all?

To sustain platform development, infrastructure, and growth. .5% is industry-low.

### Are there hidden fees?

No. Only .5% on winnings + BSC gas. That's it.

### Can fees change?

Current markets have .5% fixed. Future markets could have different fees, but always disclosed upfront.

### Who sets the gas price?

Not HiveBets. Gas is set by the BSC network based on congestion. You can adjust gas price in your wallet.

# Platform Fees

## Fee Structure

HiveBets has a simple, transparent fee structure:

| Fee Type           | Amount       | When Charged     | Who Pays      |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Platform Fee**   | .5%          | On winnings only | Winners       |
| **Gas Fee**        | $0 (Gasless) | Never            | Nobody (x402) |
| **Deposit Fee**    | 0%           | Never            | Nobody        |
| **Withdrawal Fee** | 0%           | Never            | Nobody        |

***

## Platform Fee (0.5%)

### How It Works

The platform charges .&#x35;**% of winnings** only:

```
Example:
You bet 1 BNB on YES
YES wins
Losing pool share allocated to you: 0.5 BNB
Platform fee: .5% Ã— 0.5 = 0.01 BNB
You receive: 1 BNB (stake) + 0.5 - 0.01 = 1.49 BNB
```

### Key Points

**Only on winnings**, not on your initial stake\
**Only if you win** - losers pay no fee (they lose their bet)\
**Transparent** - deducted automatically by smart contract\
**No hidden fees** - .5% is the total platform fee

### Comparison

| Platform                      | Fee              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **HiveBets**                  | .5% on winnings  |
| Traditional sportsbook        | 4-10% house edge |
| Centralized prediction market | 2-5% on all bets |
| DEX trading fees              | 0.3-1% per trade |

x402 makes betting:

* **Free** - No gas fees

### Why BSC?

We chose BSC for x402 implementation because:

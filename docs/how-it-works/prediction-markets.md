# Prediction Markets Explained

## What is a Prediction Market?

A prediction market is a market where people bet on the outcome of future events. Participants buy and sell shares representing different outcomes, and the market price reflects the collective probability of each outcome.

### Generic Prediction Markets:
- Will candidate X win the election? (Polymarket)
- Will a sports team win the championship? (PredictIt)
- Will a company's stock reach $100? (Augur)

### HiveBets' Unique Focus:
**Will a Four.meme token reach a specific market cap by a deadline?**

## Why Four.meme Tokens Only?

### 🎯 HiveBets is Different

Unlike broad prediction markets that cover everything from politics to sports, **HiveBets exclusively focuses on Four.meme tokens** on BNB Chain.

**This isn't a limitation—it's our superpower.**

### The Trenches Meta Explosion

**Four.meme has become THE dominant force** on BNB Chain:
- 🔥 "Trenches" culture driving billions in volume
- 🚀 Daily token launches with explosive potential
- 💎 Community-driven momentum like no other platform
- 📈 Multiple tokens reaching $100M+ market caps

**We're specialized for this exact meta.**

### Advantages of Specialization

| Generic Markets | HiveBets (Four.meme Focus) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Predict everything | Predict one thing really well |
| No domain expertise | Deep understanding of trenches |
| Generic oracle data | BSC memecoin-optimized data |
| Broad, shallow markets | Deep, liquid Four.meme markets |
| Unfocused community | Trenches-native community |

**Bottom line**: We're not trying to be everything to everyone. We're the best at predicting Four.meme token success on BNB Chain.

## How HiveBets Markets Work

### Market Structure

Each HiveBets market has:

1. **A Token** - The memecoin being predicted (e.g., 哈基米)
2. **A Target** - Market cap goal (e.g., $100M)
3. **A Deadline** - When betting closes (e.g., October 30, 2025)
4. **Two Outcomes** - YES (reaches target) or NO (doesn't reach target)

### Example Market

```
Token: 哈基米
Question: Will 哈基米 reach $100M mcap before October 30, 2025?

YES Pool: 10 BNB (67% of total)
NO Pool: 5 BNB (33% of total)
Total Pool: 15 BNB

If YES wins: YES bettors split 5 BNB (NO pool) proportionally
If NO wins: NO bettors split 10 BNB (YES pool) proportionally
```

## Betting Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Open Market
**Duration**: From market creation → deadline

Users can:
- ✅ Place bets on YES or NO
- ✅ See live odds
- ✅ Check pool sizes
- ❌ Cannot withdraw bets
- ❌ Cannot change bets

### Phase 2: Waiting for Resolution
**Duration**: Deadline → resolution trigger

Market status:
- ❌ Betting closed (deadline passed)
- ⏳ Awaiting oracle data
- ⏳ Buffer period (1 hour)
- ❌ No claims yet

### Phase 3: Resolved
**Duration**: After resolution → forever

Market outcome:
- ✅ Final outcome determined (YES or NO)
- ✅ Winners can claim payouts
- ✅ Losers get nothing
- ❌ No more changes possible

---

## How Outcomes Are Determined

HiveBets uses **Tellor Oracle** for trustless resolution:

### Oracle Resolution Process

1. **Deadline Passes**
   - No more bets allowed
   - Market enters buffer period

2. **Buffer Period (1 hour)**
   - Ensures oracle data is available
   - Prevents frontrunning

3. **Anyone Triggers Resolution**
   - Calls `resolveFromTellor()` function
   - No special permissions needed

4. **Oracle Checks Data**
   - Fetches market cap from Tellor
   - Compares to target
   - Returns YES or NO

5. **Market Settles**
   - Outcome recorded on-chain
   - Winners can claim
   - Process complete

## Parimutuel System

HiveBets uses **parimutuel betting**, where:
- All bets go into a pool
- Winners split the losing pool
- No house odds or bookmaker

### Example Calculation

```
Market: Will $4 reach $444M?

Bets Placed:
- Alice bets 1 BNB on YES
- Bob bets 2 BNB on YES  
- Charlie bets 3 BNB on NO

YES Pool: 3 BNB (50%)
NO Pool: 3 BNB (50%)
Total: 6 BNB

Scenario 1: YES Wins
- Alice gets: 1 + (3 × 1/3) - 2% = 1.98 BNB
- Bob gets: 2 + (3 × 2/3) - 2% = 3.96 BNB
- Charlie gets: 0 BNB (lost)
- Platform fee: 0.06 BNB

Scenario 2: NO Wins
- Charlie gets: 3 + (3 × 3/3) - 2% = 5.88 BNB
- Alice gets: 0 BNB (lost)
- Bob gets: 0 BNB (lost)
- Platform fee: 0.12 BNB
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Trustless
No central authority controls market outcomes. Smart contracts and oracles handle everything automatically.

### 2. Transparent
All bets, pools, and outcomes are visible on the blockchain. Anyone can verify.

### 3. Non-Custodial
We never hold your funds. Everything happens through smart contract interactions you approve.

### 4. Automated
Markets resolve automatically using oracle data. No manual intervention required.

### 5. Fair
Max bet limits prevent whale manipulation. Parimutuel system ensures fair odds.

### Arbitrage

---

## Market Dynamics

### Early vs Late Betting

**Early Bets** (right after market creation):
- ✅ Better odds (less competition)
- ✅ More time for research
- ❌ More uncertainty
- ❌ Longer wait for resolution

**Late Bets** (near deadline):
- ✅ More information available
- ✅ Shorter wait for results
- ❌ Worse odds (pools already filled)
- ❌ Less time to react

### Odds Movement

Odds change as bets are placed:
- More YES bets → YES odds decrease (worse payout)
- More NO bets → YES odds increase (better payout)
- Self-balancing mechanism

---

## Safety Features

### Max Bet Limits
**0.1 BNB per wallet per side** prevents:
- Whale manipulation
- Market cornering
- Unfair advantage for big players

### Deadline Enforcement
- No bets after deadline
- Prevents frontrunning oracle
- Ensures fair resolution

### Cancellation Protection
- Markets can only be cancelled before deadline
- If cancelled, 100% refunds to all bettors
- Prevents rug pulls after outcome known

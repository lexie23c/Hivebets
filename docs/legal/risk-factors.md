## Main Risks

**Simple truth**: If you bet on the wrong outcome, you lose your entire bet.

**Mitigation**: Only bet what you can afford to lose completely.

### 🎲 Four.meme Tokens Are Risky

**Reality**: Four.meme tokens are highly speculative memecoins.

**Risks**:
- Extreme volatility
- Rug pulls possible
- Can go to $0 instantly
- Often anonymous developers

**Our position**: We focus on Four.meme because that's where the trenches meta is, but this doesn't mean they're "safe."

### 🐛 Smart Contract Bugs

**Risk**: Despite audits, contracts may have vulnerabilities.

**Impact**: Potential loss of funds in contract.

**Mitigation**: 
- Based on proven OpenZeppelin code
- Internally audited
- Publicly verifiable on BSCScan
- Start with small amounts

### 🔮 Oracle Issues

**Risk**: Tellor Oracle data may be delayed, wrong, or unavailable.

**Backup**: Manual resolution by resolver (introduces trust).

**Mitigation**: Tellor has proven track record; community can verify resolution data.

### 🔐 Wallet Security

**Impact**: Total loss of all wallet funds.

**Mitigation**:

### ⛽ Network Failures

**Impact**: Missed deadlines, delayed transactions, lost gas fees.

### 📊 Market Manipulation

**Risk**: Despite 0.1 BNB limits, manipulation still possible via multiple wallets.

**Mitigation**: Max bet limits, on-chain transparency.

### ⚖️ Legal & Tax

**Risk**: Prediction markets legal status varies by jurisdiction. Winnings may be taxable.

**Your responsibility**: 
- Check if legal in your location

### 💱 BNB Price Volatility

## Advanced Betting Strategies

### Early Betting

**Pros**:
- Better odds (fewer competitors)
- Larger share of your pool
- More time to analyze

**Cons**:
- Less information available
- Odds could move against you
- Longer wait for resolution

### Late Betting

**Pros**:
- More information (chart patterns, momentum)
- Clearer picture of likely outcome
- Shorter wait

**Cons**:
- Worse odds (pools already large)
- Smaller share of pool
- Risk of missing deadline

### Hedging

**Strategy**: Bet on both sides

**Example**:
```
Bet 0.08 BNB on YES
Bet 0.02 BNB on NO

Scenario A: YES wins (high probability)
- Profit from YES, lose small NO bet
- Net: +0.03 BNB

Scenario B: NO wins (low probability but high payout)
- Profit big from NO, lose YES bet
- Net: +0.06 BNB
```

**When to hedge**:
- Uncertain about outcome
- Want to reduce variance
- Willing to sacrifice max profit for safety

### Contrarian Betting

**Strategy**: Bet against the crowd

**Example**:
```
YES Pool: 9 BNB (90%)
NO Pool: 1 BNB (10%)

If you bet NO and win:
- You get 9 BNB / 1 BNB = 9x return!

Risk: You're betting against consensus
Reward: Massive upside if correct
```

**When to go contrarian**:
- You have unique insight
- You think crowd is wrong
- Risk-tolerant personality

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Betting More Than You Can Afford

**Solution**: Only bet disposable income. This is speculative!

### ❌ Not Checking Current Market Cap

**Solution**: Always check DEXScreener before betting.

### ❌ Forgetting About Gas Fees

**Solution**: Leave extra BNB for gas. Don't bet your entire balance.

### ❌ Betting Last Minute

**Solution**: Give yourself time. Network congestion could delay your transaction.

### ❌ Ignoring Odds Changes

**Solution**: Understand that payouts depend on final odds, not current odds.

### ❌ Rage Betting After a Loss

**Solution**: Take a break. Don't chase losses.

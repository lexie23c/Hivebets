## Market Resolution

### Resolution Timeline

1. **Market Created** → Betting opens
2. **Deadline** → Betting closes
3. **Buffer Period** (1 hour) → Waiting for oracle data
4. **Resolution** → Market outcome determined
5. **Claims Open** → Winners can claim payouts

### Resolution Methods

#### Primary: Hivebets Oracle

* Automatic resolution via Hivebets Oracle
* Fetches real-world market cap data
* Compares to target market cap
* Returns YES or NO

#### Fallback: Manual Resolution

* If oracle data unavailable or disputed
* Resolver manually resolves with verifiable proof
* Community can verify on BSCScan

[Learn more about oracle resolution →](../how-it-works/oracle-resolution.md)

### Outcome Determination

**YES wins if**: Token market cap ≥ Target market cap at deadline\
**NO wins if**: Token market cap < Target market cap at deadline

**Examples**:

```
Market: Will 哈基米 reach $100M by Oct 30?

Scenario A:
- At deadline: $115M market cap
- Outcome: YES ✅

Scenario B:
- At deadline: $95M market cap
- Outcome: NO ✅

Scenario C:
- At deadline: Exactly $100M
- Outcome: YES (>= target)
```

***

## Payouts

### Winner Payouts

**Formula**:

```
Your Payout = Your Stake + (Losing Pool × Your Share) - 2% Fee

Where:
Your Share = Your Stake / Total Winning Pool
```

**Example**:

```
You bet: 0.05 BNB on YES
YES Pool: 0.5 BNB total
NO Pool: 0.3 BNB total
Outcome: YES wins

Your share: 0.05 / 0.5 = 10%
Your winnings from losing pool: 0.3 × 10% = 0.03 BNB
Platform fee: 2% × 0.03 = 0.0006 BNB
Your payout: 0.05 + 0.03 - 0.0006 = 0.0794 BNB

Profit: 0.0294 BNB (58.8% ROI)
```

### Loser Payouts

**If you bet on the losing side**: 0 BNB

Your entire stake goes to the winning pool.

### Claiming

**When**: Immediately after market resolves\
**How**: Click "Claim Winnings" button on market page\
**Cost**: Gas fee (\~$0.14)

**You must claim manually**. Payouts are not automatic.

**Parimutuel system** ensures fair odds\

* Result: Odds tend toward fair value

***

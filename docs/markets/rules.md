## Payouts

### Winner Payouts

**Formula**:
```
Your Payout = Your Stake + (Losing Pool √ó Your Share) - 2% Fee

Where:
Your Share = Your Stake / Total Winning Pool
```

**Example**:
```
You bet: 0.05 BNB on YES
YES Pool: 0.5 BNB total
NO Pool: 0.3 BNB total
Outcome: YES wins

Your share: 0.05 / 0.5 = 10%
Your winnings from losing pool: 0.3 √ó 10% = 0.03 BNB
Platform fee: 2% √ó 0.03 = 0.0006 BNB
Your payout: 0.05 + 0.03 - 0.0006 = 0.0794 BNB

Profit: 0.0294 BNB (58.8% ROI)
```

### Loser Payouts

**If you bet on the losing side**: 0 BNB

Your entire stake goes to the winning pool.

### Claiming

**When**: Immediately after market resolves  
**How**: Click "Claim Winnings" button on market page
